# For future game developers that will be creating the other two micro games:
I made my micro game using Typescript, and you can too! All Javascript code is also valid Typescript code, so whether you have your files labeled with .js or .ts doesn't really matter. Regardless, they can be used interchangeably (and can help you refactor your code to make it more type-safe).

It'll be made with Phaser, and the first micro game (future dorchester) can be used as an example for how you can create yours.

Start working with `npm start` and get to coding!
